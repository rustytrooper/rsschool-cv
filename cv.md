#### I have already learned at last stage0, but I released that its too early for me to go forward and study at stage 1, So I decided to dive into java script a little deeper, so last six month I did things about studying by myself, and I hope that knowledges that I achieved by myself will help me this time. Good luck for all students of this curse and don’t give up, you’ll cope with this!

```
let initStr = "12345678910";

 function getProbebly(str) {
 let arrFromStr = Array.from(str);
 let reverse = arrFromStr.reverse();
 console.log(reverse);
 let subarrSize = 3;
 let matrix = [];
 for (let i = 0; i <= reverse.length; i += subarrSize) {
 matrix.push(reverse.slice(i, i + subarrSize));
 }
 let output = matrix.map((el) => el.join("")).join(" ");
 let reversedAnswer = output.split("").reverse().join("");
 console.log(reversedAnswer);
 }
 getProbebly(initStr);
